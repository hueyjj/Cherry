Memory usage
    PyQt5 application itself takes around 10-20 MB depending on how many componenets there are.
    youtube_dl takes at least 20+ MB, even when just imported.

Linux
    We need to convert all files from dos to unix format.
    pyuic5.exe is needed to covnert .ui files to .py files.
        https://askubuntu.com/questions/612314/how-to-install-pyqt-for-python-3-in-ubuntu-14-10
    We need to add instructions on how to build on linux

Windows
    We need to add information on how to get all the dependencies such as pyui5.exe.

Atomic parsely and ffmpeg (important)
    These two need to be bundled with our program, other wise youtube-dl will throw errors when itself
    cannot embed thumanails (and possibly more).
